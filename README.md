# FusionToolLibrary

This repo contains a Fusion 360 tool library that covers most CNC tooling available at narwhal labs. This serves as a guideline, and may not be optimal feeds and speeds for all machines. This tool library is intended to be used with an AvidCNC PRO series rack and pinion drive CNC router with a 2.2KW spindle and NEMA34 steppers.
