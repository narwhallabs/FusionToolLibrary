# ToolLibraries

This repo contains a Fusion 360 tool library that covers most CNC tooling available at narwhal labs as well as a Vectric vCarve library with basic cutting and engraving tools. This serves as a guideline, and may not be optimal feeds and speeds for all machines. These libraries intended to be used with an AvidCNC PRO series rack and pinion drive CNC router with a 2.2KW spindle and NEMA34 steppers.
